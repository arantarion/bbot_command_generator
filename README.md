# BBot Command Generator

## Overview
The **BBot Command Generator** is a web-based tool designed to simplify the creation of BBot commands. I know that the code is a mess. 


## Usage

### 1. Input the Target
At the top of the interface, enter the target for your BBot command.

### 2. Select Modules, Flags, and Presets
Choose the modules, flags, and presets you'd like to include in your command. Tooltips are available for each option to provide descriptions.

### 3. Configure Additional Options
- **Name**: Enter a name for the project with the `-n` flag.
- **Output Directory**: Specify the output directory using the `-o` flag.
- **Proxy through Burp**: Enable this option to route traffic through Burp Suite. You can use the default proxy URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8080`) or specify a custom one.

## Installation
1. **Open the `bbot_gui.html` file in your web browser** to start using the tool.
